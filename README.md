This repository contains Python code that identifies and displays the dominant colors in an image using computer vision techniques. The project utilizes libraries such as OpenCV, NumPy, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib to extract and visualize the most prominent colors in an image.

**Features**

1. Load an image from file
2. Resize the image for faster processing
3. Convert the image from BGR to RGB
4. Apply K-means clustering to identify dominant colors
4. Display the original image along with the dominant colors and their proportions
   
**Requirements**
1. Python 3.x
2. OpenCV (cv2)
3. NumPy
4. Matplotlib
4. scikit-learn
5. imutils
